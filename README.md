# CovidINdia
A telegram bot that updates the user on the statistics of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Using the Telegram Bot is quite simple, all that's required is for the user to type out "/stats" along with the two-lettered state/UT code (available if you enter /help), and voila, you're up to date with the statistics.
